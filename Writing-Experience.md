# About Me

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from BITS Pilani University in India and a Master's degree in Statistics from Rutgers University. 

I have scored well on exams that test Language, Reasoning and Quantitative Aptitude 
- CAT : 99.90th percentile
- GMAT : 760 (99th percentile)
- GRE : 337/340 (Quant 170 : 96th percentile; Verbal 167 : 98th percentile)

My professional career involved working in various different roles ranging from Operations, Content Creation, Product Development and Management, Teaching (online classes), Tutoring, and Software Development. 

During these various stints, one common skill that I got to put to use over and over again was my technical writing skills.

## Operations
As an Operations manager (and eventually as the head of the Operations department), one key area of the job is to document a typical user's journey (both as a prospective customer and as a customer), experiences, and pain points. This not only helps address user concerns efficiently, but also identify opportunities for scope of improvement in the product offering and in the customer experience. 

Personally, I not only had to jot down how a user would reach the website (of the organization for which I worked at the time) and interact with it, but also sift through huge repository of existing emails from users, tag them by the nature of their query, identify the scope of improvement in responses being sent for each kind of query and document standardized responses that better address the user's concerns. This not only helped improve the user experience, but also helped the team be more efficient.

## Content Creation
As a content creator, my primary role was to create questions for the Quant, Critical Reasoning, Sentence Correction, and Reading Comprehension sections of the GMAT. This work involved understanding the kind of nuances that are tested in GMAT questions (by analyzing hundreds of Official GMAT questions) and the type of idiomatic usages allowed in the languge, and creating questions and solutions following these practices. I have created numerous GMAT-like questions following this process.

## Product Development and Management
As the head of the Product Development team, my primary role was to guide the team that developed and managed content. In order to be able to achieve this, I was always looking for scope of improvement in the product offerings through competitor benchmarking and by going through content-related queries raised by students. Identifying patterns in them, coming up with solutions/improvements, and documenting them (and documenting any corresponding learnings and guidelines) helped the team be more efficient and effective at creating subsequent content. 

## Online Teaching
Apart from my work as a content creator and product manager, I had to conduct live webinars for GMAT aspirants. One effective way I found to improve the experience of the students was to carefully document the queries that arised during every webinar I conducted, identifying the root cause(s) for those queries and addressing them in the webinar content for subsequent such webinars (This also entailed reworking the entire webinar experience if needed). This led to my recognition as [one of the best GMAT instructors on GMAT Club](https://gmatclub.com/reviews/highest-rated-gmat-instructors).

## Tutoring
Personally tutoring students also entailed work that is quite similar to Online Teaching, except in this case, I also had to factor in the student's strengths, weaknesses, likes, dislikes etc. and document them along with my other notes. The subsequent work involved tailoring the content for the student so that their takeaways from each class are maximized as much as possible. 

## Software Development
Although coding might not be considered as technical writing by many (which is true in a sense), the actual job as a software developer who owns and develops a feature end to end definitely involves much more writing work than merely 'fiddling with code'. There is a lot of technical writing involved in the job starting from gathering the user requirements, transcribing them to technical requirements, envisioning the feature design, writing the feature specifications, and later, writing a user guide and FAQs specific to the developed feature.
